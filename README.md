# Form Formik React - A Form Management Application

**Form Formik React** is a web application that utilizes Formik to handle form state and validation in a seamless and efficient manner. The application allows users to create, manage, and submit forms easily while ensuring a user-friendly experience.

It is built using:

- **React**
- **Formik** (for form management)
- **Yup** (for validation schema)
- **CSS** (for styling)

## ðŸ‘¾ Features

- Easy form creation with dynamic input fields.
- Built-in validation using Yup for form fields.
- Responsive design for a great user experience on all devices.
- Clear error messages for invalid inputs.
- Simple and intuitive interface for users to fill out forms.

## ðŸ“’ Process

I started by setting up the project with React and integrated Formik for managing form state and validation. The application is designed to be user-friendly, allowing users to input their data without hassle.

I used Yup to define validation rules for the form fields, ensuring that users receive immediate feedback on their input. The UI is styled with CSS, providing a clean and responsive layout.

**NOTE:** This project showcases the use of Formik and Yup for efficient form management in React applications.
